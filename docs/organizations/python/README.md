# Python 

Python has a [application template](https://github.com/python-gsoc/python-gsoc.github.io/blob/master/2019/application2019.md), so be careful!

[Python Foundation projects](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations/4923862075047936/#projects) are divided between sub-orgs with lots of different topics, like data science, statistics, source control management and others.
