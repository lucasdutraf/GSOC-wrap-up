# Triage Tickets
- Access [unreviewed tickets](https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=!closed&stage=Unreviewed) page
- Try to reproduce the bug
    - If the bug seems valid make a note that you confirmed the bug and accept the ticket
- Even if you don't fix the bug yourself, try writing a test for it!
- Anyone can help with a ticket, removing a invalid tags, categorizing tickets
- More tips about it are available at [Django documentation about triaging](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/triaging-tickets/#how-can-i-help-with-triaging)
