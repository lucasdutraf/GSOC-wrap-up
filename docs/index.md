# GSOC Wrap Up
A documentation that wraps up a bunch of first steps for contributing from GSOC's organizations.

## About
This repository was created with content from a [notion](https://www.notion.so/) workspace developed by [Caio](https://github.com/caiovfernandes) and [Dutra](https://github.com/lucasdutraf) for GSOC 2020 knowledge sharing. You can feel free to take notes of any kind. There are a few rules for us to keep a pattern of contribution and try to maximize the cooperation between us, these rules are:

- Please take your notes in english. We are doing this to encourage all of us to write and read in GSOC's used language.
- Follow the documentation pattern. There are some topics created by us that might cover the whole needs for applying to GSOC. If you have some suggestion of main topics, please talk to us before.
- Share with everyone that has interest in applying for GSOC
- Make sure to contribute if you have any kind of useful information that don't have been mentioned in this repository!
